# TestingGrailsApplicationsWithSpock
A plugin showing how to unit test/integration test and functional test Grails applications using Spock.

This document was created by an intern working for Black Kite technology at the end of her placement - this is a guide to her experiences of testing Grails applications using Spock.  Full documentation is available by running `grails doc`.

It covers unit and integration testing in detail and gives a brief into to functional testing with Geb.  Emphasis of the plugin is on testing services, i.e. coverage on testing of controllers is limited.  The official Grails documentation in this area can be a bit difficult to get to grips with a first and so the aim was to create a resource that is example-driven.  Please feel free to expand this document by issuing a pull request if you have other examples that you think would be helpful.
