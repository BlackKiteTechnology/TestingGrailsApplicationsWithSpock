# TestingGrailsApplicationsWithSpock
A plugin showing how to unit test/integration test and functional test Grails applications using Spock.

This document was created by an intern working for [Black Kite Technology](http://blackkitetechnology.com) at the end of her placement - this is a guide to her experiences of testing Grails applications using Spock.  Full documentation is available by downloading/cloning this repo and running `grails doc`.

It covers unit and integration testing in detail and gives a brief into to functional testing with Geb.  Emphasis of the plugin is on testing services, i.e. coverage on testing of controllers is limited.  The [official Grails documentation](http://grails.github.io/grails-doc/latest/guide/testing.html) in this area can be a bit difficult to get to grips with at first and so the aim was to create a resource that is example-driven.  Please feel free to expand this document by issuing a pull request if you have other examples that you think would be helpful.
